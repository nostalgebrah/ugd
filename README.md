## Getting started

Make sure have the following installed:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
[Gulp Command Line Utility](https://gulpjs.com/) `npm install -g gulp-cli`

##


**Quick Start**

- In your terminal change to your project directory.
- To install the project use `npm install` for all files and dependencies.
- When complete, run one of the following tasks:
  - `gulp` manually compiles files.
  - `gulp watch` automatically compiles files and applies changes using BrowserSync.

After compiling a new folder called `dist` will appear, this folder will house all your compiled files.

**Note:** Gulp only uses `devDependencies`.

##


**Using Includes for JavaScript**

Files listed with `require` will only be included if it has not been included before.

  - `//=require vendor/jquery.js` *(Specific file in the vendor folder)*
  - `//=require vendor/**/*.js` *(Any and all folders/files in the vendor folder)*

Files list with `include` will always be included.

  - `//=include relative/path/to/file.js`
